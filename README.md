# VineTrimmer-PlayReady
A tool to download and remove DRM from streaming services. A version of an old fork of [devine](https://github.com/devine-dl/devine).
Modified to remove Playready DRM instead of Widevine.

## Features
 - Progress Bars for decryption ([mp4decrypt](https://github.com/chu23465/bentoOldFork), Shaka)
 - Refresh Token fixed for Amazon service
 - Reprovision .prd after 2 days
 - ISM manifest support (Microsoft Smooth Streaming) (WIP/Experimental)
 - N_m3u8DL-RE downloader support

## Broken
 - `--bitrate CVBR+CBR` is currently broken
 - Atmos audio with ISM manifest (Amazon) is currently broken (Needs a working init.mp4). If the title has the atmos audio in MPD then it should work. 
 - ATVP service is currently broken in dev branch
 - Netflix service is currently broken (will probably be fixed Soonâ„¢)

If anyone has any idea how to fix above issues, feel free to open a pull request.

## Usage

1. Make sure git is installed in your system by running `git --version`. If not refer to [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

2. Choose a branch, either `dev` or `main`. Use below command to download. (Recommended instead of downloading zip)
   ```bash
   git clone -b <branch-name> --single-branch https://github.com/chu23465/VT-PR
   ```
   
3. Navigate and find `install.bat`

4. Run `install.bat`
   
5. Activate venv using `venv.cmd`.

6. Run desired command using poetry.


## Updating

1. Backup your `vinetrimmer/Cookies/`, `vinetrimmer/Cache/`, `/Downloads` directories just in case.
   
2. Open a command prompt and navigate your `VT-PR` directory.
   
3. Recall the branch you downloaded and modify below command accordingly:
   ```bash
   git pull origin <branch-name>
   ```


### Config

`vinetrimmer.yml` located within the `/vinetrimmer/` folder.

`decryptor:` either `mp4decrypt` or `packager`

(shaka-packager fails to decrypt files downloaded from MSS manifests)

`tag:` tag for your release group

CDM can be configured per service or per profile.

```
cdm:
    default: {text}
    Amazon: {text}
```

All other option can be left to defaults, unless you know what you are doing.

### Peacock 

 - PCOK bans leaked certs quickly (for 4k), be cautious.

### Example Command

Amazon Example:

```bash
poetry run vt dl -al en -sl en --selected -q 2160 -r HDR -w S01E18-S01E25 AMZN -b CBR --ism 0IQZZIJ6W6TT2CXPT6ZOZYX396
```

Above command:
 - gets english subtitles + audio,
 - selects the HDR + 4K track,
 - gets episodes from S01E18 to S01E25 from Amazon
 - with CBR bitrate,
 - tries to force ISM
 - and the title-ID is 0IQZZIJ6W6TT2CXPT6ZOZYX396

AppleTV Example:

```bash
poetry run vt dl -al en -sl en --list -q 720 --proxy http://192.168.0.99:9766 -w S01E01 ATVP umc.cmc.1nfdfd5zlk05fo1bwwetzldy3
```

Above command:
 - gets english subtitles + audio,
 - lists all possible qualities,
 - selects 720p video track,
 - uses the proxy for licensing,
 - gets the first episode of first season (i.e S01E01)
 - of the title umc.cmc.1nfdfd5zlk05fo1bwwetzldy3


## Proxy
I recommend [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/). You can sign up, getting 10 GB of traffic credit every month for free. We use the VPN for everything except downloading video/audio. 
Tested so far on Amazon, AppleTVPlus, Max.

### Steps:
1. For each service, within get_tracks() function we do this below.
    ```python
    for track in tracks:
        track.needs_proxy = False
    ```
    
    This flag signals that this track does not need a proxy and a proxy will not be passed to downloader even if proxy given in CLI options.

2. Download Windscribe app and install it.

3. Go to `Options` -> `Connection` -> `Split Tunneling`. Enable it.
   
    Set `Mode` as `Inclusive`.

5. Go to `Options` -> `Connection` -> `Proxy Gateway`. Enable it. Select `Proxy Type` as `HTTP`.
   
    Copy the `IP` field (will look something like `192.168.0.141:9766`)

    Pass above copied to Vinetrimmer with the proxy flag like below.

    ```bash
    ...(other flags)... --proxy http://192.168.0.141:9766 .......
    ```

## Other
 - For `--keys` to work with ATVP you need to pass the `--no-subs` flag also
 - Nuikta compile is an option to run on various linux distributions.
 - Errors arise when running VT within Docker or Conda like python distributions. Make sure to use proper python3.
 - To use programs in `scripts` folder, first activate venv then, then - 
      ```bash
      poetry run python scripts/ParseKeybox.py
      ```
